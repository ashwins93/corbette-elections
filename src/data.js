    pitch: `"Well to begin with, as opposed to earlier, I now have a deeper understanding of the duties and responsibilities that comes with being a deputy secretary. I have learned a lot of valuable lessons on how to approach things by being an active group leader and I hope to put it to use by becoming Deputy Secretary. I have done as much as I could for Corbett House in the past 4 months, and I hope that I will be able to do that, and much more if I become Deputy Secretary. I promise that I am willing to put in the hours and the effort the role of Deputy Secretary demands. I will make sure that the voice of Corbett is duly heard in the UHC meetings. I will ensure that those who do the work be recognized and given due credit for. I will ensure that the stability of the house remains Intact and that the house is supremely functional, and at the same time, I hope to brainstorm some amazing ideas with y'all to put Corbett over the edge when compared to other houses :)  I will closely work with Gagneet, the Secretary, and you amazingly wonderful group leaders to push for greater change that will make Corbett the best house there ever is! And always remember, we are in this together :)" 
    Cheers,
Robin Justin"`,

    pitch: `I am ready to put all the time and energy and strive to place our house and institute on the top. 

    Since I am the person who came from the bottoms of the house, I personally know what a Deputy Secretary means to us and the responsibility and what all problems we faced in the past. I ensure you to be well updated and forward minded in all aspects of being a Deputy Secretary.
    
    I promise each and every Corbettian to be at my best behavior and availability 
    Hope you vote for the best`,

    position: "Secretary / Deputy secretary",
    pitch: `Time has flown by so fast, we've already spent a term together as the Corbett House Council. Although there had been some ups and downs previously, I will strive to maintain a good workspace here and co-operate with our Secretary, Web Admin, the Mentors, and of course, the Group Leaders. As I've been a Group leader for a while now, I know the difficulties one faces while trying to juggle everything. But I will definitely try to decrease the pressure from our side as much as possible. 

    How do I plan to manage the responsibilities of this role along with my academics? I've learnt a lot in this 4 month period that I have spent as a Group Leader. I had to manage my academics across two degrees, my role as the Group leader, my social life, and my intern while also leaving aside a little bit of time for self-development. I'll give it to you, it wasn't easy at first but I've gotten way better at it. I really think I would be able to give the necessary time and fulfill my responsibilities and lead the house in the right direction.
