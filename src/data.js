    pitch: `"Well to begin with, I am a Fresher at college, just turned 19, and so I have got plenty time left down in my bucket to take responsibilities of any sort. I really have this love towards leadership roles too ^_^ Had a lot of experience at the school level, and at the college level too. A small instance would be the fact that I actively took part at IITM E Culturals and helped organize some of it by working closely with IITM right from the 1st to the 3rd e cultural events :) apart from experience in these roles, i love to socialize a LOT and I am an extrovert by nature. I love to check in on people every now and then to make sure they are doing okay because more than anything, the mental health of our friends are important, especially in times like these... The extroverted character of mine has an added advantage that I'd go to any extent to talk to anyone to get stuff done for our house. All being said, If i am indeed elected, I hope to do my duties to the best of my ability, and if i do end up making mistakes in between, I hope i will get the right guidance from my mentors. May the best leader win!

Cheers,
Robin Justin"`,

    pitch: `I am an IITM Metallurgy second year Undergrad. During the pandemic I was urged to plan things accordingly . At first I struggled but later I was successful at it. I completed 25 MOOC courses(Coursera, Codecademy, NPTEL, Udemy) along with 2 sems from my college and also made it through with the BSc Degree. I put up alarms, reminders after my planning. Planning has become my lifestyle. So, I think I can cope up with any type of planning and am capable of managing things.`,

    pitch: `I have been a leader since grade 1 in ny school and there is a passion inside me that involuntarily make me act like a leader like i help people whenever they want. I have good managing skills too. I Have even made the stats of our house also for easy contact. I was the Captain of my school house. I also served my state basketball team as a captain at national level. Also i was awarded the all round best captain in my school.  I think i can lead my house in a much better way than i have done before. I don't act bossy which i think should be the trait of any good leader. I help people not like being a leader but as their friend. AND ABOVE ALL THESE I'LL NOT MAKE ANY PROMISE AND ACT LIKE A POLITICIAN, I WANT EVERYONE TO JUDGE ME ON THE BASIS OF THE GHINGS I HAVE DONE FOR THEM SO FAR. `,
